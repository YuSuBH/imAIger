# History Feature Documentation

## Overview

Simple localStorage-based history feature for tracking AI operations during the demo. No backend or user accounts required.

## Implementation

### 1. History Utility (`web/lib/historyUtils.ts`)

- **Storage**: Uses browser's localStorage
- **Capacity**: Max 50 items (oldest removed automatically)
- **Data Structure**:
  ```typescript
  {
    id: string,
    type: 'generate' | 'analyze' | 'upscale' | 'bgRemove',
    timestamp: number,
    input: { prompt?, query?, imageName?, factor? },
    output: { imageUrl?, text? }
  }
  ```

### 2. History Page (`web/app/history/page.tsx`)

Features:

- View all saved operations
- Filter by operation type
- Delete individual items
- Clear all history
- Display inputs and outputs side-by-side

### 3. Integration

All pages now save operations to history:

- ✅ Generate page
- ✅ Analyze page
- ✅ Upscale page
- ✅ Background Remove page
- ✅ Playground page

## Usage

### For Users

1. Use any AI feature (generate, analyze, upscale, or remove background)
2. Navigate to History page to view all operations
3. Filter by type using the dropdown
4. Delete individual items or clear all

### Technical Notes

- **Client-side only**: All data stored in browser localStorage
- **No persistence**: Data lost if user clears browser data
- **Demo-friendly**: Perfect for presentations without backend setup
- **Privacy**: No data sent to server, stays on user's machine

## Limitations

- Not suitable for production (no user accounts)
- Data lost on browser cache clear
- Limited to ~5-10MB total storage (browser dependent)
- Images saved as URLs (may expire if using temporary blob URLs)

## Future Improvements (if needed)

- Add export/import functionality
- Save blob images as base64 for persistence
- Add search functionality
- Group by date/session
- Backend integration for multi-device sync
